      <div class="text right">
        <p>More than one hundred years ago, Edward and John Creighton were brothers who lived in the developing city of Omaha, Nebraska. Edward was a strong-willed, ambitious man. He helped to build the telegraph lines from New York to California. Then, he began his own business--The First National Bank. His brother, John, was no less of an amazing man. He created Creighton College and his philanthropy knew no bounds. However, both brothers knew Ed’s health was on the decline when he suffered from a stroke in 1871.</p>
        <p>Edward died just as he was entering a meeting for First National Bank. He had a second massive stroke and was unable to recover. When John heard about his brother’s death, he was greatly distraught. Edward collapsed onto his bed and cried his heart out. He knew he had to get his brother back… <em>somehow…</em>. </p>
        <p>The following year, events unfolded which no history book mentions: John learned the nature of the human soul through experiments with white magic, and was able to bring back his brother. Unfortunately, because bringing back Edward would require a human host, John would need to deposit him in an animal’s body to avoid murdering someone. John spent days researching different species of animals and finding their similarities to Edward. Upon one visit to the library, a strange woman wearing a cloak of opaque black brought an ornithology book to him.</p>

        <p>“This is what you’re looking for,” she spoke, her voice aged and raspy. A gnarled finger pointed to picture of a bluejay.</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“bluejays are strong creatures that defend what’s important to them.”</p>
        <p>“Why are you telling me this?”</p>
        <p>“Your brother, John. I know that you’re looking for a vessel for his soul.”</p>
        <p>Puzzled, John read the entry about bluejays. The more he read, the more he recognized John in the bird. He looked up to thank the woman, but she was gone. All that remained was a single black feather.</p>
        <p>In a fever of excitement, John rushed the book home and commenced his work. He hoped that, at last, he would find a new home for his brother’s soul.</p>

        <p>The next morning, Edward woke up to find himself in a tree overlooking his business’s building. He looked down at his chest to see a large tuft of blue and white. He glanced up at where his arms were to notice two large wings. “Oh, dear me, I’m a bird!” he squawked to himself. Experimentally, he flapped his wings and jumped from the tree. He spread his wings and floated gently to the ground.</p>
        <p>Just was he was when he was a man, Edward the bluejay was brave, proud, and strong. Every day, he was free to visit all of the projects he and his brother had built in the now-great city of Omaha. He visited the First National Bank and stood on the telegraph lines, observing the progress of the city. He occasionally visited an old woman who wore a black cloak at the park, where she fed him yummy seeds. Best of all, he enjoyed watching the construction of a great new school rise from the earth: Creighton College, the center of learning his brother envisioned and built. Over the years, the bird watched the young athletic teams battle on the field and scholars compete in challenges of the mind. Like Edward, the young men were courageous, strong, and ambitious; yet, like him, they also cared for and protected what they loved.</p>

        <p>John saw the connection between his brother and the spirit of the school. He knew that there would be no better mascot for Creighton College than that of Edward, the tenacious bluejay. To this day, the bluejay remains the mascot of both Creighton University and its preparatory school, Creighton Prep. Edward’s spirit still lives on in the bluejay that symbolizes the greatness of the school’s graduates and faculty--tenacious leaders, every one.</p>
